Categories of Ryugakusei

1\. Students who have entered a Japanese college or university with the intention of getting a degree. These students, primarily from Asia, have advanced Japanese skills, usually obtained through extensive study both in their place of origin or in languages in Japan. The bulk of _ryugakusei _in Japan are in this category. To the extent that they have chosen to leave their country of origin and study in Japan we must inquire as to why this is the case? What didn't they like about university in their country of origin? In China? In South Korea? In Vietnam? In Nepal? Etc.? Often times, the students are in Japan to both study and work. In some cases, the study is only a way into Japan in order to work, earn money, and send the money back home.

2\. Students here for short-term study. These students come by way of exchange programs that universities have with each other. Given that there are hardly any schools in Japan that have degree programs in English, however, the few students that come to study in Japan for a year or less are here to study Japanese since this, more often than not, is what they are majoring in in university.

The dream of having lots and lots of students from abroad coming to Japan to study is a dream that will likely never come true owing to the language problem. Until such a time that Japanese are in a position to think that they cannot succeed in life UNLESS they can function fluently in English, this is not going to change.
